          <p>
            My first impression of you was an old senior who came to observe our
            class but turns out you were a new student. We were put in the same
            class at first before you had to change classes into sapphires,
            which was very disappointing. You catched my eye since then becuase
            of your outstanding height and pro badminton skills. At the end of
            school year, we exchanged socials but never contacted.

          <p>
            Start of 10th grade, august: I started sitting beside you during ICT
            class. You were fun to talk to and I wanted to be friends with you.
            We exchanged discords. On your birthday, I bought you a duck. We
            were close friends but not best friends. It was a combined birthday
            party. I only bought you a present becuase you felt the closest to
            me out of the rest of the birthday guys.

            After hours of time spent on texting each other and hanging out in
            school, we went from "the best friend I could ever have" to best
            friends. Early december, I couldn't deny my feelings for you anymore
            and I wanted to be more than friends. None of us didn't make a move.
            Me personally, I didn't want to get attached to you and wanted to
            keep my distance from you. (Legit tough times)

            to delete the photos because one of their staff was in it. I
            genuinely can't find where the staff is, but we didn't delete it
            anyways.
